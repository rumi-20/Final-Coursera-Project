This is a final course project as peer graded assignment under Jhon Hopkins University Getting and Cleaning Data. 
For the assignment I used R Studio version 3.6.2. The R script run_analysis does the following tasks.

1.	Download dataset folder from shared url and read each text file as data table
2.	Column wise merges all training files 
3.	Column wise merges all testing files 
4.	Finally combines all data tables row wise to create one data table
5.	Extract measurements containing mean and standard deviation from each measurement
6.	Use descriptive activity names in code column
7.	Rename code column to activity
8.	Label the dataset columns using appropriate descriptive names
9.	Finally, summarize all the data set w.r.t to each variable for each activity and subject, and save it in a new data table named Final Project.
